# AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML.<br>
AJAX is not a programming language. Rather it's a set of technologies.<br>
AJAX helps in fetching the data asynchronously without interfering with the existing page.<br>
No page reload/refresh is done for small change in the content of page which we get from server.<br>
Mordern Websites use JSON instead of XML for data transfer.<br>
AJAX saves network bandwidth. <br>

## How it works?

AJAX uses XMLHttpRequest (aka xhr object). <br>
xhr contains many utility functions and methods using which we can call AJAX. <br>
xhr object is an in-built object in javascript. <br>
Data can be transferred in any format e.g., jason, xml, txt, html, etc. <br>
Data can be transferred in any format e.g., http, https, etc.<br>


## CODE:

<a href = "AJAX.html">AJAX Html file</a>
<a href = "AJAX.js">AJAX Js file</a>



# Fetch API:

Extended version of AJAX. Now, most people use Fetch API for get and post request actions.<br>

<a href = "FetchApi.html">Fetch API Html file</a>
<a href = "FetchApi.js">Fetch API Js file</a>
