# Document Object Model:

## Window Object
Document is an Object and a part of window. **Window object is a global object** or variable in client side javascript which we see in our browser.   <br>
*e.g., <br>
1. window.alert() and alert() both will do the same work. Therefore, there is no need to write window.<br>
2. prompt() <br>
3. confirm(): Return boolean value.<br>
4. location() <br>
5. location.href = "" or location.href for current href. <br>
6. location.reload: for loading the page again. <br>
7. history <br>
8. history.go(-1): to go one page back and history.go(1) to go one page forward.
